py5 is a new version of [**Processing**][processing] for Python 3.8+. It makes the Java [**Processing**][processing] jars available to the CPython interpreter using [**JPype**][jpype]. It can do just about all of the 2D and 3D drawing [**Processing**][processing] can do, except with Python instead of Java code.

The goal of py5 is to create a new version of Processing that is integrated into the Python ecosystem. Built into the library are thoughtful choices about how to best get py5 to work with other popular Python libraries and tools such as [Jupyter][jupyter], [numpy][numpy], and [Pillow][pillow].
